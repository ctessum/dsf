## Sort, don't filter

Traditional scientific journals make binary publishing decisions: articles are either accepted or rejected.
This was necessary when physical, printed journals were the only method of dissemination, but is vestigial in the current electronic-delivery paradigm.
This is evidenced by the rapid adoption of preprint servers (e.g., https://arxiv.org/) and journals with pre-review "discussion" versions, both of which are much less selective of which articles they will publish than conventional journals.

However, preprint and discussion publishers seem to be supplementing rather than replacing traditional journals, suggesting that the peer-review process serves a valuable function of signaling which articles are the most important and useful.
