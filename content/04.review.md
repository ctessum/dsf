## Distributed, compensated review

The traditional academic publishing system relies on reviews volunteered by scientist peers, where the definition of "peer" is determined by article authors and journal editors.
In addition to the fact that this results in for-profit publishers benefit from unpaid labor, this system results in reviewers being hard to find, the final number of reviews being small, and the review process taking a long time.
Additionally, the amount of thought put into each review can vary widely.
Because reviews are not credited or compensated, ideas and attitudes in reviews are skewed toward those of individuals for whom those considerations are less important, and therefore not necessarily representative of scientific stakeholders as a whole.

Scientific review should be compensated, and it should not be limited to the social networks of the article authors and journal editors.
Solutions exist for distributed review (e.g., https://prereview.org/, https://openreview.net/) and review recognition (e.g., https://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/02/getting-credit-peer-review), but stop short of offering monetary compensation or an equivalent incentive.
