## Minimize barriers to access to and participation in science

In practice, the legacy publication system is only accessible to scientists who work for institutions that can afford subscriptions to journal packages, and even then it can be difficult to download articles, especially when off-campus.
For scientists and aspiring scientists not associated with such an organization, even when between jobs, and especially for those in low and low and middle income countries, access is often not possible.
Open-access journals aim to solve this problem, but in practice fees are often just shifted from readers to authors, making open-access publication an option only for highly-funded researchers.
