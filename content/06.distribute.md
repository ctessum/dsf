# Distribute funding decisions

The current system of centralized funding decisions through public and private granting agencies and foundations, which rely on tacit knowledge accumulated within a relatively small set of individuals to predict which projects will be worthwhile and successful.
However, centralized decision-making can be inefficient and can propagate biases held by in-group grant officers and reviewers against out-group applicants and ideas.

We believe a distributed decision framework could provide a complementary utility to the existing centralized systems.
Distributed decision systems tend to have different biases from centralized systems, and the software systems which facilitate distributed decision making can be designed to reduce those biases.
Buterin et al. (2018; https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656) describe a new system for distributed funding decision which will serve as the core of our framework.
